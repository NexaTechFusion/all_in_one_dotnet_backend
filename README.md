## üìñ About the Project

**All In One Dotnet Backend** is a clean and modular backend solution tailored for scalability and performance. The
architecture is designed to be extendable, following best practices for separation of concerns and ensuring a high level
of maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The solution follows the **Clean Architecture** principles, which ensures that the core of the application remains
independent of external frameworks, databases, and user interfaces. The architecture is structured as follows:

- **Core**: Contains business logic and domain models.
- **Application**: Manages the application's behavior and use cases.
- **Infrastructure**: Handles data persistence, external services, and other infrastructure concerns.
- **Web API**: The entry point for external interactions, exposing endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **.NET 8** - The latest version of .NET for building high-performance applications.
- **Entity Framework Core** - For object-relational mapping (ORM) and data access.
- **SQL Server** - Primary database for persistence.
- **Redis** - For caching and improving application performance.
- **Docker** - Containerization of the application for easy deployment.
- **Swagger** - API documentation and testing tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Application

### Running Locally

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

1. **Run SQL Server Container**:
    ```shell
    docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=1234@Abcd" -p 20022:1433 --name sql22 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    ```

2. **Run Redis Container**:
    ```shell
    docker run -p 16379:6379 -d redis
    ```

3. **Configure Connection Strings**:
    - Ensure that the connection strings in `appsettings.json` (located in `src/API/AIO.Web.API/appsettings.json`) are
      correctly configured.

### Running with Docker Compose (Under Development)

You can also run the application using Docker Compose. Simply run:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

This option is still under development and may require further configuration.

### Running with Dockerfile

To run the application using a Dockerfile, follow these steps:

Build the Docker Image:

```shell
docker build . -f "src\API\AIO.Web.API\Dockerfile" --force-rm -t aio-dotnet-webapi
```

Verify the Docker Image:

```shell
docker images
```

Run the Docker Container:

```shell
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:8080 --name aio-dotnet-webapi-container aio-dotnet-webapi
```

Access Swagger UI:

Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/swagger

## üö¢ Deploying the Application

Deploying the application involves building the Docker image and running it on the target environment.

Build the Docker Image:

```shell
docker build . -f "src\API\AIO.Web.API\Dockerfile" -t aio-dotnet-webapi
```

Save the Docker Image:

```shell
docker save -o "./aio-dotnet-webapi-latest" aio-dotnet-webapi:latest
```

Upload the Image via SFTP.

Load the Docker Image:

```shell
docker load -i './aio-dotnet-webapi-latest'
```

Drop and Prepare the Database (If Required).

Stop and Remove Previous Containers:

```shell
docker stop aio-dotnet-webapi-container
docker rm aio-dotnet-webapi-container
```

Run the New Container:

```shell
docker run -d -v './src/API/AIO.Web.API/Dockerfile/appsettings.json:/app/appsettings.json' -p 20080:8080 --name aio-dotnet-webapi-container aio-dotnet-webapi
```

Configure appsettings.json:

```shell
copy appsettings.Development.json appsettings.json
nano appsettings.json
```
